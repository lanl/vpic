/* The Takizuka-Abe collision model is based on Takizuka and Abe, JCP 1977
   and efficiently models small-angle Coulomb scattering by randomly pairing
   particles. On average, each particle is scattered once per call. The model
   is fully defined by a single parameter, the base collision frequency nu0.
   In SI units, nu0 is defined by

   nu0 = log(Lambda) / 8 pi sqrt(2) c^3 eps0^2

   where log(Lambda) is the Coulomb logarithm. For a thermal species with
   temperature T, normalized mass m and charge q, the self-scattering momentum
   transfer rate (i.e., "the" collision rate) is related to nu0 via

   nu_s = 4 (mc^2 / T)^3 nu0 / 3 sqrt(pi)

   The paper defines variance ~= sqrt(2)*nu_0, and here we expect the user to
   pass us the base cvar

   nu very large, it is equivalent to resampling your particle
   normal momenta from a normal distribution with
   uth = sqrt(kT/mc)) every time this operator is applied (in MD,
   this is called an Anderson thermostat).  This method is only
   intended to be used when the temperature is non-relativistic.

/* A binary_rate_constant_func_t returns the lab-frame rate constant
   for the collisions between a monochromatic beam of species i
   _physical_ particles (with mass spi->m) and momentum pi->u{xyz}
   (normalized to spi->m spi->g->cvac where cvac is the speed of light
   in vacuum) and a monochromatic beam of species j _physical_
   particles (with mass spj->m) with momentum pj->u{xyz}
   (normalized to spj->m spj->g->cvac).

   The returned value has units of VOLUME / TIME.

   For simple non-relativistic collisions, the rate constant, K, is
   related to the total collision cross section by:

     K = vr sigma(vr)

   where vr = cvac | ui - uj | and sigma( vr ) is the collision cross
   section for particles of that relative velocity.

   For relativistic collisions, this needs to be modified to:

     K = vr sigma( vr ) [ 1 - vi.vj / c^2 ]

   where vr = sqrt( |vi-vj|^2 - |vi x vj|^2/c^2 ) is the relative
   particle velocity in a frame in which one particle is at rest, vi
   = c ui / gamma_i is particle i's lab frame velocity, gamma_i =
   sqrt(1+ui^2) is particle i's lab frame relativistic factor and
   similarly for vj and gamma_j.  [CITE: Peano et al, ARXIV
   pre-print, 2009].

   This is both inefficient and numerically unsafe method to compute
   K in this regime (it misbehaves badly in finite precision for
   relativistic particles ... which is the whole point of doing this
   correct relativistically).  Relativistically, K is better
   computed via:

     s  = gamma_i gamma_j - ui.uj - 1
     vr = cvac sqrt{ s / [ s + 1/(2+s) ] }
     K  = vr sigma( vr ) (1+s) / (gamma_i gamma_j)

   which, provided s is computed with care, has _no_ catastropic
   cancellations, no near singular divisions, behaves well for
   non-relativistic particles and behaves wells for
   ultra-relativistic particles.

   For relativity afficinados, note that s is related to the Lorentz
   boost factor and has the manifestly covariant expression s =
   Ui.Uj - 1 where Ui = (gamma_i,ui) and Uj = (gamma_j,uj) are the
   normalized 4-momenta of particle i and particle j respectively
   and the Minkowski 4-dot product has a +--- signature.
