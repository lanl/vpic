This directory contains a few sample files of how to read the arbitrary binary
format that VPIC uses to dump data. They can be used as the basis for writing
more complex scripts (e.g. parallel C++), in order to do post processing of data.

The best script to read first is `read_file.py`, which is able to read field,
hydro, and particle dumps.

Each file includes a small sample at the top of how to get started.
