/* Floating point random generators make uniform rands on [0,1],
   [0,1), (0,1] or (0,1), depending on the variant selected.  Each
   variant has a rigorous interpretation.  For the open variants, if
   the interval [0,1) is divided into 2^N sub-intervals (where N=23
   and N=52 for single and double precision respectively), the value
   returned is as if a true uniform rand on [0,1) was produced and
   rounded to the midpoint of each sub-interval (with ties breaking to
   the even interval).  For the other variants, if the interval [0,1]
   is divided into 2^N intervals (where N=24 and N=53 for single and
   double precision respectively ... note these variants have an extra
   bit of precision), the value returned is as if a true uniform rand
   on [0,1) was produced and rounded to the nearest even / down / up
   location between each sub-intervals for the closed, half open at 1
   and half open at 0 variants respectively.

   Note then that:
   - In the open variant, 0 or 1 can never be returned.
   - In the closed variant, 0 or 1 can both be returned.
   - In the half open at 1 variant, 1 can never be returned.
   - In the half open at 0 variant, 0 can never be returned.

   There are single generators for each primitive floating point type
   and domain.  Each singleton generator has a corresponding mass
   production generator.  The singleton generators not error trapped
