# Vector Particle-In-Cell (VPIC) Project

VPIC is a general purpose particle-in-cell simulation code for modeling
kinetic plasmas in one, two, or three spatial dimensions. It employs a
second-order, explicit, leapfrog algorithm to update charged particle
positions and velocities in order to solve the relativistic kinetic
equation for each species in the plasma, along with a full Maxwell
description for the electric and magnetic fields evolved via a second-
order finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) solve. The VPIC code has been
optimized for modern computing architectures and uses Message Passing
Interface (MPI) calls for multi-node application as well as data
parallelism using pthreads. VPIC employs a variety of short-vector,
single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) intrinsics for high performance
and has been designed so that the data structures align with cache
boundaries. The current feature set for VPIC includes a flexible input
deck format capable of treating a wide variety of problems. These
include: the ability to treat electromagnetic materials (scalar and
tensor dielectric, conductivity, and diamagnetic material properties);
multiple emission models, including user-configurable models; arbitrary,
user-configurable boundary conditions for particles and fields; user-
definable simulation units; a suite of "standard" diagnostics, as well
as user-configurable diagnostics; a Monte-Carlo treatment of collisional
processes capable of treating binary and unary collisions and secondary
particle generation; and, flexible checkpoint-restart semantics enabling
VPIC checkpoint files to be read as input for subsequent simulations.
VPIC has a native I/O format that interfaces with the high-performance
visualization software Ensight and Paraview. While the common use cases
for VPIC employ low-order particles on rectilinear meshes, a framework
exists to treat higher-order particles and curvilinear meshes, as well
as more advanced field solvers.

# Getting the Code

VPIC uses nested submodules.  This requires the addition of the *--recursive*
flag when cloning the repository:

    % git clone --recursive git@github.com:lanl/vpic.git

This command will check out the VPIC source code, including the Cinch
build system.  Cinch is documented
[here](https://github.com/laristra/cinch).

# Requirements

The primary requirement to build VPIC is a C++11 capable compiler and
an up-to-date version of MPI.

# Build Instructions

VPIC uses the Cinch build system.  From a user-perspective, this is
equivalent to CMake.  To configure a build, do the following from
the top-level source directory:

    % mkdir build
    % cd build

Then call the curses version of CMake:

    % ccmake ..

**or, optionally:**

    % cmake -DENABLE_MPI ..

The `./arch` directory also contains various cmake scripts (including specific build options) which can help with building

They can be invoked using something like:

    % ../arch/generic-Release

GCC users should ensure the `-fno-strict-aliasing` compiler flag is set (as shown in `./arch/generic-gcc-sse`)

After configuration, simply type 'make'.

# Building an example input deck

After you have successfully built VPIC, you should have an executable in
the *bin* directory called *vpic*.  To build an executable from one of
the sample input decks, simply run:

    % bin/vpic input_deck

where *input_deck* is the name of your sample deck.  For example, to build
the *harris* input deck in the *sample* subdirectory
*(assuming that your build directory is located in the top-level
source directory)*:

    % bin/vpic ../sample/harris
