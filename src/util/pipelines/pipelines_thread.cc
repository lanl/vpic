 * Thread dispatcher notes:
 * - Only one instance of thread dispatcher can exist at time (i.e. the
 *   application can't spawn two threads and have each thread create its
 *   own thread dispatcher).  Otherwise bad things could happen.
 * - The dispatcher assumes pipelines always return (otherwise a
 *   possible deadlock exists in parallel_execute and thread_halt _will_
 *   deadlock).
 * - The dispatcher intends that only host will call parallel_execute.
 *   (Original version of the dispatcher was less strict and most of that
 *   infrastructure is still present though.)
 * - Calls to thread_boot should always be paired with calls to
 *   thread_halt (this insures good housekeeping). To reallocate the
 *   number of pipelines available to the program, the dispatcher should
 *   be halted and then re-booted with the new desired number of
 *   pipelines.
 * - Internal: thread.n_pipeline = 0 -> Global variables need to be
 *   initialized. No other global variables should be trusted when
 *   thread.n_pipeline = 0.

 * Function: thread_boot( n_pipeline, dispatch_to_host )
 *
 * Initialize the thread dispatcher to use n_pipeline threads.
 * The underlying thread library may create extra management threads.
 * This routine does not require you to have the requested number of
 * physical processors in your system (the host and/or pipeline threads
 * will be multitasked on physical processors in that case).
 *
 * If the boolean dispatch_to_host is true, then the host thread
 * (i.e. the caller of this function) will be treated as a pipeline
 * thread.  Thus, n_pipeline-1 pipeline threads will be created.
 * thread_dispatch will execute the workload given to pipelines
 * 0:n_pipeline-2 on the n_pipeline-1 pipeline threads and the workload
 * given to pipeline n_pipeline-1 on the host thread.
 *
 * If the boolean dispatch_to_host is false, then the host thread
 * will _not_ be treaded as a pipeline thread.  Thus, n_pipeline
 * pipeline threads will be created.  thread_dispatch will execute all
 * n_pipeline workloads on the n_pipeline threads (and the host thread
 * will presumably do other things while the pipeline threads are
 * executing).
 *
 * Arguments: n_pipeline (int) - The desired number of pipelines.
 *            dispatch_to_host (int) - Should the dispatch function
 *              dispatch tasks to the host thread
 *
 * Returns: (void)
 *
 * Throws: Throws an error if
 *         * if n_pipeline is out of bounds. n_pipeline should satisfy
 *           1 <= n_pipeline <= MAX_PIPELINE
 *         * if the dispatcher was already initialized.
 *         * if something strange happened during global
 *           initialization or pipeline creation.
 *
 * Dependencies: pthread_self, pthread_cond_init, pthread_mutex_init
 *               pthread_create
 *
 * Globals read/altered: thread.n_pipeline (rw), Host (rw), Id (rw),
 *                       Pipeline (rw), Busy (rw), Dispatch_To_Host (rw)
 *
 * Notes:
 * - This should only be called once by at most one thread in a program.
 * - The calling thread becomes the Host thread.
 * - Calls to thread_boot should always be paired with calls to
 *   thread_halt for good housekeeping.
